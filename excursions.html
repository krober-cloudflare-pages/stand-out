                <p>Hop in a zebra-striped 4X4 Land Rover with a personal guide and take a ride on the wild side. Drive deep into the mountains of Jamaica. 
                    Walk along a tropical river. See lush foliage, flowers and wildlife you've never seen before. Discover hidden waterfalls and a natural 
                    swimming pool just off the beaten path. Take the plunge. Enjoy the journey-- and the swim! </p>

                <p>Travel high above the Jamaican jungle landscape from a series of decks and platforms by zipline and walkways. Soar like a bird, 
                    gliding silently above the rainforest. Hear and see the rushing waters below, as you zip across a thousand-foot stretch of river 
                    canyon at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. Your guide – a certified specialist in tropical canopy exploration – will provide tips 
                    about what to see and do during this amazing adventure. Let the fun begin!</p>

                <h2 class="heading">Horseback Ride & Swim</h2>
                <p>Saddle up for some of the best guided horseback riding in Jamaica. Take a spectacular journey on a well-trained horse, 
                    ambling along panoramic cliff-side trails through a tropical rainforest and into the Jamaican countryside. But your ride isn’t 
                    over until you follow a special path down to the beach for a refreshing jaunt aboard your horse through the warm Caribbean surf.</p>

                <p>Put on your swimwear and take the scenic ride to Dunn’s River Falls near Ocho Rios.  The swift-flowing waterfalls cascade down more than 
                    600 feet, as the Dunn River rushes from the mountains into the Caribbean. Climb the freshwater falls with the aid of a guide. Ready 
                    for more beach time? Just stroll down to the shoreline to sunbathe and swim on a beach where they filmed a classic James Bond film.
