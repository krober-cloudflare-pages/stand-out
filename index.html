            beach... sun-kissed, carefree days...</em>
            Your exciting trip to Montego Bay is just
            around the corner, and we can't wait for
            you to enjoy the best of Jamaica during your

            <h2>Spirit of the Caribbean</h2>
            <p>As stunningly beautiful as its Caribbean counterparts, Jamaica sets itself apart with a captivating spirit all its own. 
                Perfect blue waters, stunning coral formations and powder-soft beaches lead to a landscape that is equally impressive. 
                Rushing waterfalls crash into ethereal-blue swimming holes, a network of streams cascade through the jungle and vibrantly 
                colored flora and fauna dot the lush green landscape.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Activities are an ideal way to explore this tropical paradise. Soar above the rainforest canopy on a zipline tour, 
                take a Jeep safari into the mountains or explore the countryside on a horseback riding excursion. 
                The pristine blue waters offer adventure as well. Swim with the dolphins, snorkel in the warm Caribbean waters, 
                kayak along one of Jamaica’s 100-plus rivers or simply sail away on a catamaran cruise. Top-notch golf, gourmet 
                cuisine and amazing music round out the offerings in this perfectly laidback locale.
